# Season 1
## How to search the MOM6 codebase on github
## Distributed nature of MOM6 code across different development hubs / github repositories
## How to find code that corresponds to a particular executable (both ACCESS-NRI and other MOM6 executables e.g. from Angus)
## How to find what diagnostics are available
## Overview of MOM6 configuration (input files etc)
## Searching through the MOM parameter docs and other output, e.g. what’s in what file, how to interpret maxCFL, truncations, warnings, errors
## Overview of MOM6 code structure - 
## How to contribute code back to MOM6
